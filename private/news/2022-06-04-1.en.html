<p>Familine 4.10 introduces a new feature: UI in English. At this time, translations are done progressively across the entire Familine infrastructure, Familine Docs being the most complicated application to translate (because it contains a lot of user content).</p>

<!---->

<p>To enable the English translation (which you should have already done since you see this news post in English), visit your account page and change the value for "Language":<br><img src="https://bucket.minteck.org/Screenshot 2022-06-04 at 3.22.13 PM.png" style="width:400px;max-width:100%;"></p>

<p>Do note that all options other than French will put Familine in English; if you select for example Spanish, Familine will be in English.</p>

<p>So, why translate Familine in English? There might be, in the far family, people who are more comfortable communicating in English than in French. Translating Familine in another language than French can only be beneficial for users. Furthermore, Familine being open-source software that any family can use as they want; making it available in another language means more families can use the software.</p>

<p>By the way, Familine should go out of early access and become accessible to the entire family around late June. However, the marketing team is not able to make advertisements like there were for Familine 3.</p>
